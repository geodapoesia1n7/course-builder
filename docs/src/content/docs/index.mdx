Course Builder is a free, open-source platform for building and selling an
online course for developers (or anybody, really). It's built on top of
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Features

Course Builder is built by example and intended as a reference for building
your own course platform. It includes:

- Course Builder CLI for scaffolding and deploying your course website
- Common UI Components
- Flexible, but opinionated, information architecture
- Stripe integration for payments
- Email automation to handle transactional and marketing email
- Lightweight LLM (AI) to augment and assist course creators
- Support tools for managing learner accounts and payments

:::note
Course Builder is not a hosted platform. It's a reference implementation for
building your own course platform.

The features above are aspirational and not fully implemented yet.
